# NexChat Customization Project - Planning Document

## Vision & Purpose

To transform the existing G4F Chat application into a branded NexChat application with a custom user interface, branding elements, and deployment configuration while preserving all original functionality. The customized app will be deployed using Docker Desktop.

## Project Scope

### In Scope:
- Rebranding the application (name, logo, color scheme)
- Customizing UI elements and styling
- Updating favicon and application icons
- Ensuring Docker deployment compatibility
- Maintaining all existing functionality

### Out of Scope:
- Adding new features or functionality
- Modifying the backend logic or API structure
- Changing the authentication system
- Server-side optimizations

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript in the `g4f/gui/client/` directory
- **Backend**: Python Flask server in the `g4f/gui/server/` directory
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for easy deployment and portability

## Technical Constraints

1. Must preserve all existing functionality
2. Must maintain compatibility with Docker Desktop
3. Must not alter core JavaScript functionality
4. Must keep all HTML elements with IDs referenced in JavaScript
5. Changes must not exceed 500 lines of code in a single implementation to avoid AI token limitations

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Version Control**: Git

## Key Files for Customization

### Frontend Files:
- `g4f/gui/client/index.html` - Main HTML template
- `g4f/gui/client/static/css/style.css` - CSS styling
- `g4f/gui/client/static/img/` - Image assets directory
- `g4f/gui/client/static/img/site.webmanifest` - Progressive Web App manifest

### Docker Files:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration
- `docker/Dockerfile` - Docker image definition
- `docker/background.png` - Docker background image

## Customization Phases

### Phase 1: Asset Preparation
- Create or source new branding assets
- Define new color scheme
- Prepare icon and logo files

### Phase 2: UI Customization
- Update HTML branding elements
- Modify CSS variables and styling
- Replace image assets

### Phase 3: Docker Configuration
- Update Docker configuration files
- Modify Docker image name and settings

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- Test application locally
- Verify Docker deployment
- Final adjustments

## Quality Assurance Strategy

- Incremental changes with testing after each significant modification
- Visual verification of UI changes
- Functional testing of core features after customization
- Docker deployment testing

## References

- Original application documentation
- Docker Desktop documentation
- The AI_GUIDELINES.md file for AI Assistant guidelines
- CSS and HTML best practices

## Decision Log

1. Preserve all JavaScript functionality intact to avoid breaking core features
2. Focus on visual customization rather than functional modifications
3. Use Docker for deployment to ensure portability and consistency
